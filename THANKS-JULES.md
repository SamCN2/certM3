# Thank You Jules! ðŸŽ‰

## The Critical Insight That Saved the Day

Jules, your suggestion to use `ExtraExtensions` instead of `Extensions` in the certificate template was absolutely brilliant and solved a frustrating issue that had us stumped for quite a while.

### The Problem
We were trying to add a custom group extension (OID `1.3.6.1.4.1.10049.2`) to certificates generated by our Go signer, but the extension kept disappearing from the final certificate. We tried:
- Manual ASN.1 manipulation
- Re-signing certificates
- Various encoding approaches
- Everything short of switching languages!

### The Solution
Your insight that Go's `x509.CreateCertificate` function preserves extensions in `ExtraExtensions` but not in `Extensions` was the key. This is a subtle but critical distinction in Go's crypto/x509 package.

### The Result
Now our certificates properly contain the group extension with:
- âœ… Correct OID: `1.3.6.1.4.1.10049.2`
- âœ… Proper ASN.1 encoding as SEQUENCE of UTF8String
- âœ… Groups: `["test391696", "users"]`
- âœ… All tests passing

### Why This Matters
This preserves our ability to use Go's excellent coroutines and native UNIX socket support, which are perfect for our certificate management system. We didn't have to compromise on language choice or architecture.

## Technical Details
The fix was simple but crucial:
```go
// Before (didn't work)
template.Extensions = append(template.Extensions, groupExtension)

// After (works perfectly)
template.ExtraExtensions = append(template.ExtraExtensions, groupExtension)
```

Thank you for saving us from what could have been a major architectural pivot! Your deep knowledge of Go's crypto libraries made all the difference.
