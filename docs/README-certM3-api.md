# certm3-api

This application is generated using [LoopBack 4 CLI](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Command-line-interface.html) with the
[initial project layout](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Loopback-application-layout.html).

## Install dependencies

By default, dependencies were installed when this application was generated.
Whenever dependencies in `package.json` are changed, run the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

To only install resolved dependencies in `package-lock.json`:

```sh
npm ci
```

## Run the application

```sh
npm start
```

You can also run `node .` to skip the build step.

Open http://127.0.0.1:3000 in your browser.

## Configuration

The API service uses a centralized configuration system located in `src/config.ts`. This system provides:

1. Type-safe configuration through TypeScript interfaces
2. Environment-specific settings (development/production)
3. Centralized management of API and database settings

### Configuration Management

The configuration is automatically selected based on the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. Available environments:
- `development` (default)
- `production`

To run in a specific environment:
```bash
# Development (default)
npm start

# Production
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

### Security Considerations

- Configuration values are version-controlled
- Sensitive values should be managed through secure configuration management
- Environment variables are only used for environment selection
- Database credentials should be managed securely in production

## Rebuild the project

To incrementally build the project:

```sh
npm run build
```

To force a full build by cleaning up cached artifacts:

```sh
npm run rebuild
```

## Fix code style and formatting issues

```sh
npm run lint
```

To automatically fix such issues:

```sh
npm run lint:fix
```

## Other useful commands

- `npm run migrate`: Migrate database schemas for models
- `npm run openapi-spec`: Generate OpenAPI spec into a file
- `npm run docker:build`: Build a Docker image for this application
- `npm run docker:run`: Run this application inside a Docker container

## Tests

```sh
npm test
```
