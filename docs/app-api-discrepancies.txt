App Calls:
GET /request/${requestId}
GET /request/check-username/${username}
POST /request
POST /request/${requestId}/validate
OpenAPI Spec: These endpoints are not defined in the spec
Fix: Add these endpoints to the OpenAPI spec with proper request/response schemas
Certificate Signing Endpoint Mismatch
App Calls: POST /certificates/sign
OpenAPI Spec: No certificate signing endpoint defined
Fix: Add the certificate signing endpoint to the OpenAPI spec
Response Format Mismatch
App Expects: Direct response data (e.g., response.data.id, response.data.username)
OpenAPI Spec: No response schemas defined for these endpoints
Fix: Add proper response schemas to the OpenAPI spec
Error Response Handling
App Expects: 404 for username availability check
OpenAPI Spec: No error responses documented
Fix: Document all possible error responses in the OpenAPI spec
Authentication
App Uses: Bearer token for certificate signing
OpenAPI Spec: No security schemes defined
Fix: Add security schemes to the OpenAPI spec
The fundamental issue is that the app is making calls to endpoints that aren't documented in the OpenAPI spec. This could lead to:
Confusion about the actual API contract
Difficulty in maintaining the API
Potential breaking changes if the API is updated without considering these undocumented endpoints
To fix this, you would need to:
Add all missing endpoints to the OpenAPI spec
Document the request/response schemas
Document error responses
Add security schemes
Ensure the spec accurately reflects the actual API behavior
