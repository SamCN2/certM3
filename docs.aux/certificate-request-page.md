# Certificate Request Page Plan

## Overview
The certificate request page is a critical component of the application that facilitates the transition from user validation to certificate issuance. This document outlines the flow and requirements for this page.

## Flow
1. **User Validation**:
   - After the user validates their account, they are redirected to the certificate request page.
   - The page should identify the user based on the validation link or session data.

2. **Private Key Password Prompt**:
   - The user is prompted to enter a password for their private key.
   - This password will be used to encrypt the private key, ensuring security.
   - **Important**: The private key is generated and stored locally in the user's browser and is never sent to the server.

3. **CSR Generation**:
   - Once the password is provided, the application will generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using JavaScript.
   - The CSR will include the user's public key and other necessary information.
   - The private key remains in the user's browser and is not transmitted to the server.

4. **CSR Submission**:
   - The generated CSR is submitted to the API for processing.
   - The API will handle the CSR and initiate the certificate issuance process.

5. **User Feedback**:
   - The user should receive feedback on the status of their request (e.g., pending, approved, rejected).

## Requirements
- **Security**: Ensure that the private key is securely stored and encrypted locally in the user's browser.
- **User Experience**: Provide clear instructions and feedback to the user throughout the process.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage any issues during the CSR generation or submission.

## Next Steps
- Review the API documentation to ensure the correct endpoints are used for CSR submission.
- Design the user interface for the certificate request page, including input fields for the password and any other necessary information.
- Implement the JavaScript logic for private key generation and CSR creation in the application.

## Dependencies
- API endpoints for CSR submission.
- User session management to identify the user after validation.

## Conclusion
This plan provides a structured approach to implementing the certificate request page, ensuring a smooth transition from user validation to certificate issuance. Any feedback or additional requirements should be incorporated into this plan.
